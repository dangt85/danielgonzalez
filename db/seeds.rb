# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).

# Examples:
#   
#   cities = City.create([{ :name => 'Chicago' }, { :name => 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Major.create(:name => 'Daley', :city => cities.first)

I used a great CSS template to get started and began to add some nice features such as Google Analytics, Re-captcha, a simple blog with pagination and a contact form with a mailer.
